# Pawnee Memory Game

This is a memory game created with React and deployed to Heroku. Building this site required me to break the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

To play, click on a Parks and Rec character's image only once, without repeating. The characters order will then shuffle on the page. You'll earn one point for every new character you click on - 12 points would be a perfect game. Your highest score from each round is displayed, along your current round's score.
